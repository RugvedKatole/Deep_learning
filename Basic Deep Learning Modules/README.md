# Basics of Deep Learning
This Repository contains python notebooks which implement deep learning using numpy library to help you understand the basics of deep learning
# Suggested Use
Read about the logistic regression model and try to understand its working. Once you have cleared theory you can try the first basic module called logistic regression using deep learning mindset

Once you have completed the first module next Read about neural networks and how do they propagate forward and backward, otimising using gradient descent algorithm
Then you can try Planar Data Classification with one hidden layer and once you have got your concepts right on this modules correct the to implement them yourselfs with a different data set and finally proceed to the Last module i.e Deep Neural network application.

you can find datasets on kaggle or by using google dataset search

PS: Feel to add new notebooks and documentation for fundamental concepts, just fork this repo and send a pull request
